# pywiim

Python interface for the [WiiM](https://www.wiimhome.com/) device API.

## Ruminations

This package was born out of a desire to integrate a WiiM Pro streamer with
Home Assistant. Part of the integration required some sort of library to
perform the API calls, which is where pywiim came in.

WiiM provides a fairly straightforward API for interacting with their
streamers (as far as I know they all utilize the same API).

[You can find this API on WiiM's website.](https://www.wiimhome.com/pdf/HTTP%20API%20for%20WiiM%20Mini.pdf)

## Installation

(WIP) You can install `pywiim` from [PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/pywiim/).

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install pywiim
```

## Implementation Notes

As you will notice from using the `PyWiim` class, the main methods available are
designed to be used asynchronously. This was chosen to align best with Home
Assistant's asynchronous functionality.

You also might notice that `verify_ssl` is set to `False` for the actual GET
requests. This is required due to the API implementation from WiiM.

## Example Usage

```python
import asyncio
from pywiim import PyWiim
from pywiim.const import *

async def main():
    # Get an instance of the class (provide the WiiM IP address)
    p = PyWiim("192.168.1.123")

    # Doing some funky stuff to call async functions
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        p.get_device_information(),
        p.get_connection_status(),
        p.get_playback_status(),
        p.mute(),
        p.set_loopmode(PYWIIM_SHUFFLE),
        p.get_eq_presets(),
        p.load_eq("Jazz"),
        p.disable_eq(),
        p.get_shutdown_timer(),
        p.play_audio_url("https://hd1.wamu.org/wamu-1"),
        p.set_volume_relative(-10),
        p.get_playback_status(),
    )

    # Run all of the above commands, order not guaranteed
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        print('\n')

# Asyncio yadda-yadda
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())
loop.close()
```
